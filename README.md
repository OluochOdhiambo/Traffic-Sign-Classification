## Task Description
 Road safety is a major challenge across the world and artificial intelligence is proving to be a useful tool for tackling this problem. Over recent years, huge advancements have been made in the technological field especially in the development of autonomus cars. The identification of traffic signs is relevant in that it is used to program the functioning of the autonomus vehicle as would be the case for human drivers.
 Since this is not a new problem, I used the data set to experiment with transfer learning and particulaly the VGG-16 architecture.
